# SM-Achievements
Achievements plugin for SourceMod, similar to steam/xbox/playstation.

This will be a plugin designed for CS:S achievement monitoring. All data will be stored in a remote SQL database, as I have no interest in using SQLi. The primary focus will be for bunnyhop at first, but down the road there is a possibility for variable requirements for obtaining achivements that will allow server managers to create their own, if they so please.

The goal is to have a very simple to use plugin that can be installed and configured in minutes.
